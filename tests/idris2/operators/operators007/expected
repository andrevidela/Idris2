Error: Operator !> is a regular operator, but is used as an automatically-binding (autobind) operator.

Test:11:28--11:30
 07 | (>>) : Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
 08 | (>>) = (>>=)
 09 |
 10 | both : Maybe (Nat, Nat) -> Maybe Nat
 11 | both m = (MkPair x y := m) !> Just (x + y)
                                 ^^
Explanation: regular, typebind and autobind operators all use a slightly different syntax, typebind looks like this: '(name : type) !> expr', autobind looks like this: '(name := expr) !> expr'.

Possible solutions:
 - Write the expression using regular syntax: 'm !> Just (x + y)'.
 - Change the fixity defined at Test:5:1--5:12 to 'export autobind infixr 0 !>'.
 - Hide or remove the fixity at Test:5:1--5:12 and import a module that exports a compatible fixity.
 - Did you mean '>>' ?
